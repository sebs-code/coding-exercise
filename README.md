## Exercise 1

Clean up the script in the 'ex-1' folder. Resolve any bugs in the script, and make the code as Pythonic (including adhering to PEP-8 standards) as possible.


## Exercise 2

The Soybean Django app is designed to display Soybean condition data from the US National Agricultural Statistics Service, however the app needs some work!

Please complete the following for the Soybean app (contained within the 'ex-2' folder'):

  1) Look inside the models file to find a description of the Soybean condition data. Use that description to create a Django ORM model.
  2) Migrate the new model.
  3) Create a superuser, log into the admin panel, and add some dummy data to this model (2/3 entries will suffice).
  4) Write a frontend view (at the URL 'soybean'), that queries the ORM for all entries, and displays them in an HTML page. How you display the data is up to you (e.g. list, table).
